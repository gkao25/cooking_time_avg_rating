# Relation Between Cooking Time and Average Rating
Project for DSC 80 at UCSD

# Introduction

We have two datasets containing the recipes and ratings from the website <food.com>, and we would like to assess the relation between cooking time and average rating. This question is interesting because cooking is an important part of enjoying your food, like if you might choose to order some fast food as take out rather than cooking more delicious food yourself because it takes too long. When rating a recipe, a person is rating on the whole cooking process and the finished dish. 

**Questions**: What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?


## Take a look at the original datasets

### recipes

This dataset has 83782 rows and 12 columns, and the most relevant column being `minutes`, which describes the cooking time.

|     124416 |      120345 | 2011-08-06 |        0 | Just an observation, so I will not rate.  I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.  I also own the Edna Lewis cookbook in which this appears. |
| 2000192946 |      120345 | 2015-05-10 |        2 | This recipe was OVERLY too sweet.  I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and jsut add on from there.  Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!                                                                                                                            |


## Cleaning the datasets

First, we merge the two datasets together by their `recipe_id` and call it `data`.

If we look at this specific row:

```data[data['rating']==0].loc[11, 'review']```

We see that it gives a positive review: "We tried it last weekend and it the entire family loved it!  Spicy but not too spicy.  It is the best chili I&#039;ve ever tried.  Great Crock Pot recipe and the house smelled great while cooking!  Awesome!  In the process of cooking our second batch to take to a Halloween party tonight."

Thus from the example above, we can see that some people wrote positive reviews but gave a rating of 0. We can infer that the reviewer probably did not mean to rate the recipe a zero, and it is only shown as a zero perhaps because they forgot to give a number rating, so 0 should be replaced with `np.nan` and we can assess its missingness later.

After filling in all the 0 ratings with null values, we find the average rating per recipe as Series and add it to the dataset, and drop the duplicated `recipe_id` column and rename `id` and `avg_rating` columns. Below are the resulting columns and their datatypes. 

| column name    | datatype|
|:---------------|:--------|
| name           | object  |
| minutes        | int64   |
| contributor_id | int64   |
| submitted      | object  |
| tags           | object  |
| nutrition      | object  |
| n_steps        | int64   |
| steps          | object  |
| description    | object  |
| ingredients    | object  |
| n_ingredients  | int64   |
| user_id        | int64   |
| date           | object  |
| rating         | float64 |
| review         | object  |
| avg_rating     | float64 |

Certain columns such as `tags`, `nutrition`, `steps`, and `ingredients` look like lists but are actually string objects, so we'd like to turn them into lists. For the `nutrition` column in particular, all the lists have the same length and contains value in this order: `[calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), and carbohydrates (PDV)]`. We would split them into individual numerical columns. The first five rows of the resulting cleaned dataset is as follows. 

| name                                 |   recipe_id |   minutes |   contributor_id | submitted   | tags                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |   calories (#) |   total fat (PDV) |   sugar (PDV) |   sodium (PDV) |   protein (PDV) |   saturated fat (PDV) |   carbohydrates (PDV) |   n_steps | steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   user_id | date       |   rating | review                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   avg_rating |

Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.

Since this is a merged dataset and some recipes have multiple reviews, we group the dataframe by `recipe_id` so each piece of information doesn't get counted multiple times. Below is the summary of the grouped dataframe, and we can see how the values are different, for example the mean of `minutes`.

Using the grouped dataframe, we plot a histogram to see the number of recipes by the cooking time.

<iframe src="assets/cooking_time_outlier_hist.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Clearly the dataset contains outliers. There are some recipes that require more than 10000 minutes, which is over 1 week. We will drop these values from the main dataset `data` and store them in a separate dataframe in case we need them later. Below is the summary of the new `data`. We can see that the mean cooking time is about 1h 15m, and 75% of the recipes in our dataset are done within 1h.

With the outliers removed, we can plot a barplot to see the count of each rating. 

<iframe src="assets/rating_count_bar.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Most recipes receive a rating of 5.


## Bivariate Analysis

We would like to look or some association between the average rating and cooking time of recipe. We plotted the two numerical variables against each other on a scatter plot. 

<iframe src="assets/avg_rating_cooking_time_scatter.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Most datapoints are in the upper left corner, where the cooking time is short and average rating is high, and there seems to be a slight negative trend. We would like to look more closely at the cluster, where cooking time is within 60 minutes, the third quartile mark of `minutes`.

<iframe src="assets/avg_rating_cooking_time_1h_scatter.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Now, there does not seem to be any correlation. 

To do some more interesting bivariate analysis, we can look at the nutrition columns. Since there are multiple columns that contain a recipe's nutritional value, we would use a scatter matrix and compare every pair of factors and look for correlations.

<iframe src="assets/nutritions_scatter_matrix.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

There seem to be positive correlations between calories/total fat, calories/sugar, calories/protein, calories/saturated fat, calories/carbohydrates, carbohydrates/sugar, saturated fat/total fat, protein/total fat.


## Interesting Aggregates

We know that a recipe can receive multiple reviews, and it would be interesting to see if a user has given multiple reviews. Doing a value counts by the `user_id`, we could see that yes, there are users that have give multiple reviews. Below are the top 5 users, and the user that gave the highest number of reviews is 424680 with 4934 reviews.

|user_id |# of reviews|
|-------:|----------:|
| 424680 |      4934 |
| 383346 |      2522 |
| 169430 |      2336 |
|  37449 |      2261 |
| 128473 |      1979 |

We could make a pivot table that shows the different number ratings that a user has given. For example, the user 1535 has given 3 threes, 29 fours, and 47 fives. 

|   user_id |   1.0 |   2.0 |   3.0 |   4.0 |   5.0 |
|----------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|      1535 |   nan |   nan |     3 |    29 |    47 |
|      1581 |   nan |   nan |   nan |   nan |     1 |
|      1634 |   nan |   nan |   nan |   nan |     2 |
|      1676 |   nan |   nan |   nan |   nan |     2 |
|      1792 |   nan |   nan |   nan |   nan |     1 |


# Assessment of Missingness

## NMAR Analysis

We want to know which columns have missing values, and how many null values exactly. 

|column name          |# of missing values|
|:--------------------|------:|
| name                |     1 |
| recipe_id           |     0 |
| minutes             |     0 |
| contributor_id      |     0 |
| submitted           |     0 |
| tags                |     0 |
| calories (#)        |     0 |
| total fat (PDV)     |     0 |
| sugar (PDV)         |     0 |
| sodium (PDV)        |     0 |
| protein (PDV)       |     0 |
| saturated fat (PDV) |     0 |
| carbohydrates (PDV) |     0 |
| n_steps             |     0 |
| steps               |     0 |
| description         |   114 |
| user_id             |     0 |
| date                |     0 |
| rating              | 15010 |
| review              |    57 |
| avg_rating          |  2766 |

Only one recipe does not have `name`, which I believe is an outlier and therefore MAR. The `description` column has some null values, meaning that some contributors did not write a description for their receipes. Perhaps these values are missing because the recipe is very simple and self-explanatory by its name, therefore needing no further description. The missing `description` are depedent on `name`, so the column is MAR. The `rating` column has many missing values, and the `avg_rating` column as well, which is calculated from `rating`. The null values in `rating` were previously 0, so I believe these values are MAR because if we look at their corresponding `review` they could be positive, and the user might have simply forgotten to give a number rating. In conclusion, I believe there is no column in my dataset that is NMAR. 

## Missingness Dependency 

We would like to analyze the missingness of avg_rating depending on rating. Since their means are very close so we will use KS statistics.

```KstestResult(statistic=0.18427714856762156, pvalue=0.0, statistic_location=5.0, statistic_sign=-1)```

At the confidence level of 5%, we reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same with a p-value of 0.0, and that `avg_rating` is dependent on `rating`.

Next we would like to analyzing the missingness of rating depending on cooking time. Both are numerical columns so we will do a permutation test and use the difference in group means as our test statistics. 

<iframe src="assets/mean_diff_hist.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

The probability that the means of ratings and cooking time (minutes) are more extreme than the observed statistic (represented by the red line) is 0.0, so we would reject the null hypothesis that the two columns `rating` and `minutes` are dependent on each other. 


# Hypothesis Testing

**Questions**: What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?

**Null Hypothesis**: There is no relationship between cooking time and average rating of recipes.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: The average rating of recipes is dependent on the cooking time. 

We will perform a permutation test that shuffles the `avg_rating` column. 

<iframe src="assets/hypo_test_mean_diff_hist.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

The probability that the means of ratings and cooking time (minutes) are more extreme than the observed statistic (represented by the red line) is 0.0, so we would reject the null hypothesis that there are no relationships between the `avg_rating` and `minutes` columns.
