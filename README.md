# Relation Between Cooking Time and Average Rating
Project for DSC 80 at UCSD

# Introduction

We have two datasets containing the recipes and ratings from the website <food.com>, and we would like to assess the relation between cooking time and average rating. This question is interesting because cooking is an important part of enjoying your food, like if you might choose to order some fast food as take out rather than cooking more delicious food yourself because it takes too long. When rating a recipe, a person is rating on the whole cooking process and the finished dish. 

**Questions**: What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?


## Take a look at the original datasets

### recipes

This dataset has 83782 rows and 12 columns, and the most relevant column being `minutes`, which describes the cooking time.

|     124416 |      120345 | 2011-08-06 |        0 | Just an observation, so I will not rate.  I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.  I also own the Edna Lewis cookbook in which this appears. |
| 2000192946 |      120345 | 2015-05-10 |        2 | This recipe was OVERLY too sweet.  I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and jsut add on from there.  Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!                                                                                                                            |


## Cleaning the datasets

First, we merge the two datasets together by their `recipe_id` and call it `data`.

Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.

data[data['rating'] == 0].loc[11, 'review']


If we look at this specific row:

```data[data['rating']==0].loc[11, 'review']```

We see that it gives a positive review: "We tried it last weekend and it the entire family loved it!  Spicy but not too spicy.  It is the best chili I&#039;ve ever tried.  Great Crock Pot recipe and the house smelled great while cooking!  Awesome!  In the process of cooking our second batch to take to a Halloween party tonight."

Thus from the example above, we can see that some people wrote positive reviews but gave a rating of 0, meaning that the reviewer did not give the receipe a number rating (perhaps because they forgot), so 0 should be replaced with `np.nan` and we can assess its missingness later.

After filling in all the 0 ratings with null values, we find the average rating per recipe as Series and add it to the dataset, and drop the duplicated recipe_id column and rename id and average rating columns. Below is the resulting columns and their datatypes. 

| column name    | datatype|
|:---------------|:--------|
| name           | object  |
| minutes        | int64   |
| contributor_id | int64   |
| submitted      | object  |
| tags           | object  |
| nutrition      | object  |
| n_steps        | int64   |
| steps          | object  |
| description    | object  |
| ingredients    | object  |
| n_ingredients  | int64   |
| user_id        | int64   |
| date           | object  |
| rating         | float64 |
| review         | object  |
| avg_rating     | float64 |

Certain columns such as `tags`, `nutrition`, `steps`, and `ingredients` look like lists but are actually string objects, so we'd like to turn them into lists. For the `nutrition` column in particular, all the lists have the same length and contains value in this order: `[calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), and carbohydrates (PDV)]`. We would split them into individual numerical columns. The first five rows of the resulting cleaned dataset is as follows.

Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.

Since this is a merged dataset and some recipes have multiple reviews, we group the dataframe by `recipe_id` so each piece of information doesn't get counted multiple times. Below is the summary of the grouped dataframe, and we can see how the values are different, for example the mean of `minutes`.

Using the grouped dataframe, we plot a histogram to see the number of recipes by the cooking time.
